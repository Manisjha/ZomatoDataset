# 🍽️ Zomato Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Zomato restaurant dataset. The goal is to uncover actionable insights about restaurant ratings, customer preferences, and service types, while preparing the data for predictive modeling and business intelligence applications.

Inspired by Krish Naik’s Day 1 live session on EDA, this project demonstrates real-world data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques using Python.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset contains information about restaurants listed on Zomato, including:
- Restaurant names and locations
- Cuisines offered
- Ratings and votes
- Delivery options
- Cost for two people
- Online ordering and table booking availability

---

## 🧠 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess raw data  
- Engineer meaningful features for analysis  
- Visualize patterns and correlations  
- Prepare the dataset for machine learning workflows

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Encoding and preprocessing

---

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Standardizing categorical entries

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Extracting city from location  
   - Encoding binary and multi-class features  
   - Creating new columns for analysis

3. **Visualization**  
   - Distribution of ratings and votes  
   - Popular cuisines and locations  
   - Correlation heatmaps

---

## 📈 Insights  
- Online ordering and table booking show strong correlation with higher ratings  
- Certain cuisines and cities dominate the platform  
- Cost and rating patterns vary significantly across regions
